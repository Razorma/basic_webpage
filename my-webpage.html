              I have always wanted to visit durban because it is not only a
              place of intertainment it is also a place where you can experience
              the majestic Drakensberg Mountains, the abundant wildlife of
              Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Game Park, and the wetland wonders of St. Lucia,
              by driving just two-and-a-half to three-and-a-half hours outside
              of the city.

                  Although Barberton Greenbelt rock formations date back some
                  3.5 million years, a 2003 study concluded that the ironstone
                  deposits believed to contain the ancient life forms actually
                  date to more recent geologic eras.

                I have always wanted to visit durban because it is not only a
                place of intertainment it is also a place where you can
                experience the majestic Drakensberg Mountains, the abundant
                wildlife of Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Game Park, and the wetland wonders
                of St. Lucia, by driving just two-and-a-half to three-and-a-half
                hours outside of the city.

                      oldest museums in South Africa. It was initially created
                      as a place to house collections of plants and animals from
                      the region, but over time it expanded to include

                      This area is considered to be one of the oldest and most
                      well-preserved rock formations in the world, and the
                      fossils found here are some of the oldest on record.
                      Visitors can see a variety of fossils, including those of
                      early bacteria and single-celled organisms, as well as
                      evidence of ancient volcanic activity.

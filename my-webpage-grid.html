                place of intertainment it is also a place where you can
                experience the majestic Drakensberg Mountains, the abundant
                wildlife of Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Game Park, and the wetland wonders
                of St. Lucia, by driving just two-and-a-half to three-and-a-half

                    fossils of microscopic life forms more than 3 billion years

                    some 3.5 million years, a 2003 study concluded that the
                    ironstone deposits believed to contain the ancient life
                    forms actually date to more recent geologic eras.

                    The Barberton Museum is located in Barberton which is known
                    for its rich history and is considered to be the oldest in
                    the province. It was initially created as a place to house
                    collections of plants and animals from the region, but over
                    time it expanded to include collections of art, history, and
                    geology. One of the main attractions at the Barberton Museum
                    is the collection of fossils from the Barberton Greenstone
                    Belt.
